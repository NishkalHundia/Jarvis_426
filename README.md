# JarWiz - Gesture and Action Recognition Software

## Inspiration

The creation of JarWiz was born out of a desire to overcome the limitations of traditional keyboard and mouse inputs, especially in the context of accessibility and user interaction. Witnessing the challenges faced by individuals with motor impairments, and recognizing the potential for gesture recognition to revolutionize computing, we set out to develop a product that empowers users to interact naturally with computers. JarWiz is driven by a vision to make computing more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for all users, embracing inclusivity and innovation.

## What It Does

"JarWiz" is a groundbreaking gesture and action recognition software that redefines computer accessibility. Liberating users from traditional inputs, it introduces intuitive gestures for seamless control. Beyond accessibility, JarWiz serves as a generic gesture control interface, with applications in various fields, including hardware control and annotation. The technology allows users to operate computers through hand gestures and voice commands, transforming the user experience.

## How We Built It

Our implementation of JarWiz utilizes OpenCV (cv2) to map hand gestures in real time. Computer vision techniques were employed to detect and track hand movements, recognize gestures, and translate them into actionable commands. The integration of Whisper, a cutting-edge speech-to-text library, further enhances the user experience by allowing voice commands alongside gestures. JarWiz not only offers versatile interaction but also supports hardware control, enabling intuitive manipulation through gestures.
